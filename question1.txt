Q1: The following actions, do they require the OS to use kernel mode or user mode is sufficient? Explain. 
1.Starting a new process. 
2.Multiplying two floating numbers stored in an application’s memory. 
3.Writing the results of the multiplication to a temporary log file on disk. 

Answers:
1. Starting a new process. 

The system is in user mode when the operating system is running a user application such as handling 
a text editor.The transition from user mode to kernel mode occurs when the application requests the 
help of operating system or an interrupt or a system call occurs.
The mode bit is set to 1 in the user mode. It is changed from 1 to 0 when switching from user mode to kernel mode.


The system starts in kernel mode when it boots and after the operating system is loaded, it executes 
applications in user mode. There are some privileged instructions that can only be executed in kernel mode.
These are interrupt instructions, input output management etc. If the privileged instructions are executed 
in user mode, it is illegal and a trap is generated.
The mode bit is set to 0 in the kernel mode. It is changed from 0 to 1 when switching from kernel mode to user mode.


2. Multiplying two floating numbers stored in an application’s memory. 

When we multiply two numbers in user mode we do not need any functions or any hardware so in this case it is better
to use user mode over kernel.

3. Writing the results of the multiplication to a temporary log file on disk. 

Writing temporary files in user mode is not allowed so in this situation we can only use kernel.
